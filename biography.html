            <p>The woman brought up her son, working on two jobs at the same time. Only Leo’s Russian grandmother Elena Smirnova helped her. She left Russia at the age of 2 during the October Revolution, so TV viewers often think that the actor has Russian roots. His grandmother married the German Wilhelm Indenbirken and took his surname. Irmelin, Leonardo's mother, was born in a bomb shelter in Erkenshvik, the West German city, in 1943.</p>
            <p>Leo’s mother, who during her pregnancy visited the museum of Leonardo da Vinci, gave the name to the future five-time nominee for Oscar. The woman was very impressed by the works of the Italian artist.</p>
            <p>Leonardo had a dream to become a famous actor since childhood. Leonardo DiCaprio began his acting career when he was a child. When Leonardo was 2.5 years old, he played in an episode of children's TV show. As a teenager, the future film actor joined theatre courses and studios, where he diligently studied acting. Later for 4 years he studied at one of the universities of Los Angeles, where he also chose the theater faculty.</p>

        <p>After Titanic such films as “The Beach”, “Gangs of New York”, “Inception”, “Romeo and Juliet” and “Catch Me If You Can” and "The Aviator", "The Departed" and " Shutter Island” were also successful. The viewers liked the roles of DiCaprio in these films. In "The Departed" DiCaprio played the role of Billy Costigan, a policeman under cover.</p>
        <p>In the drama "The Beach" DiCaprio played an American tourist who visited Thailand in search of a good salary. Here, Leonardo played along with Tilda Swinton and Virginia Ledoyen. There was a box office boom, but critics did not like the film.</p>
        <p>The same cool reaction of critics received the film "The Man in the Iron Mask", where DiCaprio appeared in the role of Louis XIV. But the box office again pleased the creators and actors of the film: the film raised $ 180 million.</p>
        <p>A criminal tragicomedy "Catch Me If You Can" received much better reviews. DiCaprio played Frank Abagnale, one of the most famous criminals of 60s. This role brought the artist the third Golden Globe and huge box office.</p>

        <p>In 2016, the film "Revenant ", where Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Will Poulter and Donal Gleason starred, was released. The film tells about the trapper Glass (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), wounded during bear hunting. The film became an event in the film industry and was released in Russia in January 2016.</p>
        <p>This Movie is not only increased the number of DiCaprio’s admirers, but also stopped Oscar series of failures. For his role in the film "Revenant " Leo was recognized as the best actor of the year. After the release of the film on Internet, the memo "Leo and the cherished Oscar" appeared. Many users remembered that the actor went to the reward too long, turning such a "path" into a joke.</p>
        <p>DiCaprio won Oscar in the nomination "Best Actor", and also received other awards. "Revenant" helped him to achieve the desired result.</p>
        <p>This work can be called a kind of example of a life where hatred and revenge help a person to survive even in seemingly hopeless situations. In his struggle for life, Glass restores justice, which allows him to avenge his son, and also to kill the treacherous and mercenary John Fitzgerald.</p>
