					American actor Leonardo DiCaprio has won 46 awards from 168 nominations, and was named runner-up for
					4 of those nominations. He has been nominated for six Academy Awards, four British Academy Film
					Awards and nine Screen Actor Guild Awards, winning one award each from them and three Golden Globe
					Awards from eleven nominations.
				</p>
				<p>
					DiCaprio received three Young Artist Award nominations for his roles in television shows during the
					early 1990s—the soap opera Santa Barbara (1990), the dramedy Parenthood (1990), and the sitcom
					Growing Pains (1991). This was followed by his film debut in the direct-to-video feature Critters 3
					(1991).He played a mentally challenged boy Arnie Grape in the drama What's Eating Gilbert Grape
					(1993), a role that earned him nominations for a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best
					Supporting Actor.At age 19, he became the seventh-youngest nominee in the category for the latter
				</p>
				<p>
					Three years later, he played a lead role in Romeo + Juliet (1996), for which he earned a Best Actor
					award from the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1997 DiCaprio received his first Screen Actors
					Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance By a Cast in a Motion Picture for his role as
					Hank Lacker in Marvin's Room. Leonardo featured opposite Kate Winslet in the romantic drama Titanic
					(1997), the highest-grossing film to that point.For the role of Jack Dawson in the film, he garnered
					the MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance, his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor
					nomination and second Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance By a Cast in a Motion
					Picture nomination. For a role in The Beach, he was nominated in two categories at the 2000 Teen
					Choice Awards, including Film – Choice Actor.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the film also earned him a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor nomination. DiCaprio was
					cast in the role of con-artist Frank Abagnale in the crime drama Catch Me If You Can, and starred in
					the historical drama Gangs of New York—films that earned him two nominations at the 2003 MTV Movie
					Awards. For the role in Steven Spielberg's film, the actor earned his second Golden Globe Award for
					Best Actor nomination
				</p>
				<p>
					DiCaprio was nominated for his first Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and
					Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor In A Leading Role for his role as Howard Hughes in the
					biographical drama The Aviator (2004); he also won a Golden Globe Award in the same category and
					received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance By a Cast in a Motion Picture. For
					his next appearances—the crime drama The Departed (2006), the war thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the
					drama Revolutionary Road (2008) and the biographical drama J. Edgar (2011)—he garnered Golden Globe
					Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama nominations. For Blood Diamond, he also received an
					Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. DiCaprio earned nominations for the Saturn Award for Best
					Actor for his roles in the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010) and the science fiction
					thriller Inception (2010). He co-produced and played stockbroker Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall
					Street (2013), a role that earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. The film was nominated
					for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, although it failed to win in any
					category. He won the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, BAFTA Award, and Academy Award
					for Best Actor for his portrayal of Hugh Glass in 2015's The Revenant. For playing aging television
					actor Rick Dalton in the comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), he received nominations
					for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA and a Screen Actors Guild Award.
